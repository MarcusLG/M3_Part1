# Using Neural Network for Defect Prediction (Regression Model)

## Core
The program is in the form of a script to construct the simple feed-forward neural network and the training process. At the end of the training, simple analysis will be carried out to show the trend of loss movement throughout the training epochs.

Additional information is being documented in _ann.py_

## Running the script
Typically users do not interact with the underlying code directly. In order to run the regression training, simple run the script file as shown below:
```
>python3 ann.py
```

## Requirements
Vanilla Python 3.10 the following packages
keras
IPython
matplotlib
numpy
sklearn 
tensorflow
